General Astronomy Qualifying Exam Resources
========

This repository contains the vast majority of the prep work I did for my general qualifying exam at UofT. You'll find the list of exam questions (for 2018), some real follow up questions, the cosmology primer I pieced together, and the scanned versions of my notes/answers for each section of the exam. Below is a list of useful textbooks and a list of shorthand words that you'll come across in my notes.

Shorthand
++++++++++++++

Some of these are notations are probably obvious, but you might come across the following in my hand-written notes:

* **w/** = with
* **b/c** = because 
* **bt/w** = between
* **v.v.** = vice versa
* **eqn** = equation
* **EoS** = equation of state
* **EoR** = epoch of reionization 
* **BB** = Big Bang or blackbody, depending on context
* **triangular dots** = therefore
* **DM** = dark matter
* **MW** = Milky Way
* **SF(R)** = star formation (rate)
* **SN(e)** = Supernova(e)
* **E, PE, KE** = energy, potential energy, kinetic energy
* **nu** = frequency or neutrino
* **gamma** = photon
* **sigma** = velocity dispersion, cross section, or standard deviation
* **e-, p+** = electron, proton
* **n** = neutron or number density
* **atm** = atmosphere
* **HJ** = Hot Jupiter
* **SpT** = spectral type
